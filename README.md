# Andrii Droshchak – QA Portfolio

## 👋 About Me

Hi, my name is **Andrii**. Since early 2025, I’ve been studying and practicing to become a QA Engineer.  
I’m happy to have finally found a field where I can develop myself professionally. In QA, I see the potential to make the digital world more user-friendly and reliable for everyone.

In this portfolio, I share my knowledge and showcase practical skills gained through university studies and self-learning.  
I’ve also started exploring test automation and am actively deepening my skills in that area.
